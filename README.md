Breast Cancer Data Analysis Dashboard

The dashboard combines insights from the Diagnostic (WDBC) and Prognostic (WPBC) datasets:

1. Diagnosis Distribution: Shows the balance between Malignant (M) and Benign (B) cases in the diagnostic dataset.
2. Tumor Size vs. Lymph Node Status: Highlights that Recurrent cases (R) often present with larger tumor sizes and higher lymph node counts compared to Non-Recurrent cases (N).
3. Time Distribution: Displays the distribution of time-to-recurrence vs. disease-free time.
4. Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve: Estimates the probability of remaining disease-free over time.
